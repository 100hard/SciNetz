# Phase 3 Completion Notes

## Summary
- `OpenAIExtractor` now performs authenticated requests against the OpenAI chat completions API with retry logic, JSON parsing, and logging-driven failure handling.
- `config.yaml` exposes a dedicated `extraction.openai` section so model choice, timeouts, and retry parameters are centrally managed.
- New tests validate adapter error handling, retry semantics, and an end-to-end `TwoPassTripletExtractor` flow against a mocked OpenAI response.

## Implication
Phase 3â€™s two-pass extraction pipeline now operates with a functional OpenAI adapter, so the project is ready to proceed to Phase 4 canonicalization tasks.
